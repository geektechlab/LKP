times() system call
======================

#include <sys/times.h>

clock_t times(struct tms *buf);

The times system call gets the user time and system time used by the current process and its children.

User time: Time spent by the process executing in user space

System Time:  Time spent by the process executing in kernel space.

struct tms {
	clock_t tms_utime;  /* user time */
	clock_t tms_stime;  /* system time */
	clock_t tms_cutime; /* user time of children */
	clock_t tms_cstime; /* system time of children */
};

All times reported are in clock ticks.

The number of clock ticks per second can be obtained using

sysconf(_SC_CLK_TCK);
