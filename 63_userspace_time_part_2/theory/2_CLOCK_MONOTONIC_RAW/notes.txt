CLOCK_MONOTONIC_RAW
====================

Similar to CLOCK_MONOTONIC, but provides access to a raw hardware-based time that is not  subject to NTP adjustments

CLOCK_MONOTONIC_RAW would be relevant mainly to cases where more accurate time is wanted over very short intervals

CLOCK_MONOTONIC would be preferable for longer-term timers measured in minutes, hours or days
