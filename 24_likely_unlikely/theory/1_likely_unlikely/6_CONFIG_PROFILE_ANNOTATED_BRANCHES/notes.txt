CONFIG_PROFILE_ANNOTATED_BRANCHES
====================================

By enabling CONFIG_PROFILE_ANNOTATED_BRANCHES in the kernel build config file, all the likely() and unlikely() macros will be recorded to see how many times they were correct or not.

$ cat /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/trace_stat/branch_annotated

This will show what branches are correct or not.
