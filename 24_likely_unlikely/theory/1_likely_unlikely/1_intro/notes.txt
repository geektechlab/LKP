Basics
===========

Each instruction in C is translated into machine instruction.

To complete each machine instruction, the processor goes through these (and more) stages:

1. Fetch: Read the next instruction
2. Decode: Determine the meaning of the instruction
3. Execute: Perform the 'real work' of the instruction
4. Store: Store results into memory

Instruction1        Fetch   ->  Decode  ->  Execute ->  Store
Instruction2                    Fetch   ->  Decode  ->  Execute ->  Store
Instruction3                                Fetch   ->  Decode  ->  Execute  -> Store

Each instruction in the above takes four clock cycles to complete execution.
With pipeline, you will have the total execution of 1 clock cycle/instruction.

Modern processors have pipelines with 10-31 stages.
For optimum performance, it is very important to keep all the stages as busy as possible.
