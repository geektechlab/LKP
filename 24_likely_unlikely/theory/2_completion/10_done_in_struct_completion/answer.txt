what is the meaning of done in struct completion?
==================================================

Each time complete is called, the counter is incremented by 1,

The wait_for functions only puts the caller to sleep if done is not equal to 0.

complete_all works similarly, but sets the counter to the largest possible value (UINT_MAX);

void complete_all(struct completion *x)
{
        unsigned long flags;

        spin_lock_irqsave(&x->wait.lock, flags);
        x->done = UINT_MAX;
        __wake_up_locked(&x->wait, TASK_NORMAL, 0);
        spin_unlock_irqrestore(&x->wait.lock, flags);
}
EXPORT_SYMBOL(complete_all);
