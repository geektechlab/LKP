Waiting for Completion
==========================

For a thread to wait for some concurrent activity to finish, it calls wait_for_completion() on the initialized completion structure

    void wait_for_completion(struct completion *done);

When some other part of your code has decided that the completion has happened, it can wake up anybody

    void complete(struct completion *comp);

A typical usage scenario is:

    CPU#1                                   CPU#2

    struct completion setup_done;

    init_completion(&setup_done);
    initialize_work(...,&setup_done,...);

    /* run non-dependent code */            /* do setup */

    wait_for_completion(&setup_done);       complete(setup_done);
