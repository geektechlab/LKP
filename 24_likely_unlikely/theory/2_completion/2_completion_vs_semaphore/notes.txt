Advantages of Completions over Semaphores
=========================================

	1. the semaphores are optimized (on purpose) for the non-contention case. Means initially it will not be in locked state. It will be in unlocked state initially. completion usage has the opposite default case

	2. Multiple threads can wait for a completion, and they can be released with one call
	   It's more complex to have a semaphore wake up an unknown number of threads. 

	3. Semaphores usage is for mutual exclusion
           Completion usages is typically for synchronization
