Data Structure: struct completion

struct completion {
        unsigned int done;
        wait_queue_head_t wait;
};

wait --> wait queue to place tasks on for waiting

done --> indicating whether it is completed or not

Usage:
------------

There are three main parts to using completions:

1. the initialization of the 'struct completion' synchronization object

2. the waiting part through a call to one of the variants of wait_for_completion(),

3. the signaling side through a call to complete() or complete_all().

Initialization
=================

Static:		DECLARE_COMPLETION(my_comp);

Dynamic:	init_completion(&my_comp);

In initialization:

	1. we initialize the waitqueue

	2. set done to 0, i.e. "not completed" or "not done".
