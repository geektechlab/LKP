[ set -x ] shows what mod command is doing.

long (*compat_ioctl) (struct file *filp, unsigned int cmd, 
                          unsigned long arg);

Called when a 32-bit process calls ioctl() on a 64-bit system

It should then do whatever is required to convert the argument to native data types and carry out the request.

unsigned log, unsigned int etc. size changes accross 32biit and 64bit.
