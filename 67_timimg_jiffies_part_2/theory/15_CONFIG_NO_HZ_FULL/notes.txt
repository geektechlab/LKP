CONFIG_NO_HZ_FULL=y
--------------------

If a CPU has only one runnable task, there is little point in sending it a scheduling-clock interrupt because there is no other task to switch to.

Note that omitting scheduling-clock ticks for CPUs with only one runnable task implies also omitting them for idle CPUs.

Adaptive-ticks CPU
------------------

	kernel avoiding sending scheduling-clock interrupts to CPUs with a single runnable task are called adaptive-tick cpu

Advantage for
--------------

	applications with aggressive real-time response constraints because it allows them to improve their worst-case response times by the maximum duration of a scheduling-clock interrupt
