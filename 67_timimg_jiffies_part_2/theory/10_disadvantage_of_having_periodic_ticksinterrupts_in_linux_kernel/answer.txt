What is the disadvantage of having periodic ticks/interrupts in linux kernel
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The timer interrupts are good but has one major issue: Power consumption

	With HZ option, kernel is interrupted HZ times per second in order to reschedule tasks
	If HZ is set to 1000, there will be 1000 timer interrupts per second
	This timer tick happens periodically irrespective of the processor state (idle vs busy)
	If the processor is idle, it has to wake up from its power saving sleep state every 1ms (if HZ=1000)
	Thus power consumption is increased.
