CONFIG_HZ_PERIODIC=y
-------------------------

	Used by older versions from 1990s to 2000s

Which scenarios this approach is useful?
------------------------------------------

	heavy workloads with lots of tasks that use short bursts of CPU
	where there are very frequent idle periods
	but where these idle periods are also quite short (tens or hundreds of microseconds).

Which scenarios this approach is not useful?
--------------------------------------------

	running a light workload with long idle periods
	scheduling-clock interrupts will result in excessive power consumption
	bad on battery-powered devices, where it results in extremely short battery lifetimes

	if you are running either a real-time workload or an HPC workload with short iterations
	the scheduling-clock interrupts can degrade your applications performance.
