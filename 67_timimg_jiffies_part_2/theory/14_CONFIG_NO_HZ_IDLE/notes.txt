CONFIG_NO_HZ_IDLE=y
-------------------

Primary purpose of clock interrupt is to force a busy CPU to shift its attention among multiple duties

If a CPU is idle, there is little point in sending it a scheduling-clock interrupt

The CONFIG_NO_HZ_IDLE=y Kconfig option causes the kernel to avoid sending scheduling-clock interrupts to idle CPUs

Advantage:
--------------
	A battery-powered device running a CONFIG_HZ_PERIODIC=y kernel would drain its battery very quickly, easily 2-3 times as fast as would the same device running a CONFIG_NO_HZ_IDLE=y kernel.

Problems with this approach:
----------------------------

1. It increases the number of instructions executed on the path to and from the idle loop.
2. On many architectures, dyntick-idle mode also increases the 	number of expensive clock-reprogramming operations.
