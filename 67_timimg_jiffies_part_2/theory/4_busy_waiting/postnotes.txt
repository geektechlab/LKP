Problem with this approach
---------------------------

The processor is tied up spinning in a silly loopâ€”no useful work is accomplished!

Better Solution
----------------

Reschedule your process to allow the processor to accomplish other work while your code waits

while (time_before(jiffies, delay))
	cond_resched();

This solution conditionally invokes the scheduler only if there is some more important task to run

Note: Cannot use it from an interrupt handler, only in process context
