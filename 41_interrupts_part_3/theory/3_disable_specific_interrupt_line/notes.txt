Disabling a specific interrupt line
===================================

Disabling a specific interrupt line is also called as masking out an interrupt line.

Example: you might want to disable delivery of a deviceâ€™s interrupts before manipulating its state.

void disable_irq(unsigned int irq); //Disables a given interrupt line in interrupt controller.
			            // this disables delivery of the given interrupt to all processors in system

void enable_irq(unsigned int irq); // this enables delivery of the given interrupt to all processors in system

Note: disable_irq does not return until any executing handler completes.
	callers are assured that
		a) new interrupts will not be delivered on the given line,
		b) any already executing handlers have exited

----
there is no API in Linux, to disable all interrupt on all processors in SMP. Only specific interrupt line on specific processor can be disabled.
