Accessing I/O Ports from User Space
======================================

PC-compatible systems have 64K I/O ports, all can be controlled from user space.

Before you access any ports, you must give your program permission to do so.

Permission for I/O ports on Linux is controlled by two functions

	 ioperm()
	 iopl()

Header File: <sys/io.h>

ioperm() controls access permissions to the permissions mentioned in the parameter

iopl() changes the I/O privilege level of the calling process, thus allowing among other things, unrestricted access to all ports

Note: Only the super-user can invoke both these functions.
