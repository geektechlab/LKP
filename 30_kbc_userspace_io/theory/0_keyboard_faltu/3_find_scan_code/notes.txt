How to find out the scan code of each key?
===========================================

1. Switch to Virtual Console (CTRL+ALT+F3)
2. Type showkey --scancodes
3. Type any key, it'll print its scancode in hexadecimal
4. To exit, just wait for 10 seconds

Note: you must switch to virtual console for this to work. Normal terminal won't work.
