Scan Codes
=============

Your keyboard's processor spends most of its time "scanning", or monitoring, the matrix of keys. 

If it finds that any key is being pressed, released, or held down, the keyboard will send a packet of
information known as a "scan code" to your computer.

Types of Scan Codes
=====================
	1. Make Codes : Sent when a key is pressed or held down
	2. Break Codes: Sent when a key is released

Every key is assigned its own unique make code and break code so the host can determine exactly what happened to which key by looking at a single scan code.

Scan Code Set: set of make and break codes for every key

There are three standard scan code sets, named one, two and three.

All modern keyboards default to set two.
