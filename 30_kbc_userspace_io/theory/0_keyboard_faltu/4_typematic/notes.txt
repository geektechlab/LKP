Typematic
===================

If you press a key, its make code is sent to the computer.

If you release the key, its break code is sent to the computer.

When you press and hold down a key, that key becomes typematic, which means the keyboard will keep sending that key's make code until the key is released or another key is pressed. 

How to Observe/Verify
=====================

1. Open a text editor
2. Hold down the "q" key.

When you first press the key, the character "q" immediately appears on your screen
After a short delay, another "q" will appear followed by a whole stream of "q"s until you release the "Q" key. 

There are two important parameters here:
1. Typematic Delay: short delay between the first and second "q"
2. Typematic Rate:   how many characters per second will appear on your screen after the typematic delay

You may change the typematic rate and delay using the "Set Typematic Rate/Delay" (0xF3) command. 

The typematic delay can range from 0.25 seconds to 1.00 second
The typematic rate can range from 2.0 cps (characters per second) to 30.0 cps
