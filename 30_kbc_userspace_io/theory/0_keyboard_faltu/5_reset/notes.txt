Reset
==========

At Reset Command,  the keyboard performs a diagnostic self-test referred to as BAT (Basic Assurance Test) and loads the following default values

	Typematic delay 500 ms.
	Typematic rate 10.9 cps.
	*Scan code set 2.
	*Set all keys typematic/make/break.

*Variable in some keyboards, hard-coded in others. 

When entering BAT, the keyboard enables its three LED indicators, and turns them off when BAT has completed. 

At this time, a BAT completion code of either 0xAA (BAT successful) or 0xFC (Error) is sent to the host.
