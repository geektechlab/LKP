PC keyboard subsystems consist of two parts:
1. The keyboard with its cable
2. A keyboard interface that links the keyboard to a host computer

Keyboard
==========

Keyboards consist of a large matrix of keys, all of which are monitored by an on-board processor

The processor:
	1. Monitor which key(s) are being pressed/released and send the appropriate data to the host
	2.  takes care of all the debouncing

Keyboard Controller
===================

Your motherboard contains a "keyboard controller" that is in charge of decoding all of the data received from the keyboard and informing your software of what's going on.

All communication between the host and the keyboard happens through keyboard controller

An Intel 8042/compatible microcontroller is used as the PC's keyboard controller.

In modern PCs, the KBC is integrated in the motherboard chipset

$ dmesg | grep 8042
