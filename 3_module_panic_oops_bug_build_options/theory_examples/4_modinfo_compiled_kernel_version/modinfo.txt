Understanding modinfo output
==============================

vermagic: When loading a module, the strings in the vermagic value are checked if they match. If they don't match you will get an error and the kernel refuses to load the module. 

intree: All kernel modules start their developments as out-of-tree. Once a module gets accepted to be included, it becomes an in-tree module.

srcversion: is an MD4 hash of the source code used to compile the kernel module. It is calculated automatically at build time from modpost script. Can be used for checking if given .ko is loaded by user or he is using previous only when we distribute .ko to customer.

retpoline: "Retpoline" was introduced to be a solution to mitigate the risk of Spectre bug.
