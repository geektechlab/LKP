------------------
tainting of kernel will be stored in dmesg only once. re-loading will not display that message.
so, to check it we need to do following:
------------------

At runtime, you can query the tainted state by reading 

$cat /proc/sys/kernel/tainted
-------
After [reboot], value of above file will be 0
-------

If that returns 0, the kernel is not tainted;

any other number indicates the reasons why it is.

The easiest way to decode that number is the script kernel-chktaint

https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/plain/tools/debugging/kernel-chktaint

----------
running above script will tell the reason of tainting
For raw taint value decoding from the message, check flags.txt in this directory
