cdev_init vs cdev_alloc
==========================

struct cdev *cdev_alloc(void)
{
        struct cdev *p = kzalloc(sizeof(struct cdev), GFP_KERNEL);
        if (p) {
                INIT_LIST_HEAD(&p->list);
                kobject_init(&p->kobj, &ktype_cdev_dynamic);
        }
        return p;
}


void cdev_init(struct cdev *cdev, const struct file_operations *fops)
{
        memset(cdev, 0, sizeof *cdev);
        INIT_LIST_HEAD(&cdev->list);
        kobject_init(&cdev->kobj, &ktype_cdev_default);
        cdev->ops = fops;
}


 struct cdev *my_dev = cdev_alloc();

    if (my_dev != NULL)
    	my_dev->ops = &my_fops;  /* The file_operations structure */
	my_dev->owner = THIS_MODULE;

cdev_init(struct cdev *cdev, const struct file_operations *fops);

The owner field of the structure should be initialized to THIS_MODULE to protect against ill-advised module unloads while the device is active.
