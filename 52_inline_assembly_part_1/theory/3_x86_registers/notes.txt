x86_64 registers
------------------

x64 assembly code uses sixteen 64-bit registers.

Additionally, the lower bytes of some of these registers may be accessed independently as 32-, 16- or 8-bit registers. 

In 16-bit mode, the register is identified by its two-letter abbreviation

In 32-bit mode, this two-letter abbreviation is prefixed with an 'E' (extended). (Example EAX)

In 64-bit version, the 'E' is replaced with an 'R' (register), so the 64-bit version of 'EAX' is called 'RAX'.
