In our previous program, we created a single device, let's modify the code to create multiple device nodes for example: 5 device nodes 

While allocating the device numbers, we need to specify the number of minor devices in the count argument:

int alloc_chrdev_region (dev_t * dev, unsigned  baseminor, unsigned  count, const char * name);

We need to create an array of struct cdev, and register each of the cdev with one minor number.

check 5 device nodes created:
ls /dev/msg*
