wait_event(queue, condition);

queue -->	wait queue head to use.

condition --> arbitrary boolean expression that is evaluated by the macro before and after sleeping; 

The process goes to sleep only if the condition evaluates to false. Care is taken to avoid the lost wake-up problem.

Some other thread of execution (a different process, or an interrupt handler, perhaps) has to perform the wakeup for you, since your process is, of course, asleep.

void wake_up(wait_queue_head_t *queue);

Note: until condition evaluates to a true value, the process continues to sleep.
