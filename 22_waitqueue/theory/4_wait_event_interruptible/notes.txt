wait_event_interruptible(queue, condition)

It can be interrupted by signals

This version returns an integer value that you should check; a nonzero value means your sleep was interrupted by some sort of signal, and your driver should probably return -ERESTARTSYS.

void wake_up_interruptible(wait_queue_head_t *queue);
