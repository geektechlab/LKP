Issue using schedule/wake_up_process
====================================
	1. Need to write code carefully to avoid lost-wakeup problem

	2. Waker process needs to know the task_struct of the sleeping process. 
	   This can become tedious when there are more than one process involved in sleeping.

Wait queues
=============

Wait queues are a higher-level mechanism which handles
	1. putting processes to sleep and 
	2. waking them up.

Wait queues are used to enable processes to wait for a particular event to occur without the need for constant polling.

A wait queue is a simple list of processes waiting for an event to occur.

Processes sleep during wait time and are woken up automatically by the kernel when the event takes place.

Header File: <linux/wait.h>

Data Structure: wait_queue_head_t

struct wait_queue_head {
        spinlock_t              lock;
        struct list_head        head;
};

typedef struct wait_queue_head wait_queue_head_t;

lock -->	used to protect its own resources from being accessed by multiple processes at the same time

head -->	List of wait_queue_entry
