How can i wait for few usecs in linux kernel?
----------------------------------------------

Backed by busy-wait loop: udelay(unsigned long usecs)

Backed by hrtimers: usleep_range(unsigned long min, unsigned long max)

Why is there no usleep / What is a good range?
-----------------------------------------------

Since usleep_range is built on top of hrtimers, the wakeup will be very precise, thus a simple usleep function would likely introduce a large number of undesired interrupts.
