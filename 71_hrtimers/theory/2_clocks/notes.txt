clocks
------------

Every hrtimer is bound to a specific clock.

The system currently supports two clocks:

1. CLOCK_MONOTONIC:
	a clock which is guaranteed always to move forward in time
	it starts at zero when the system boots and increases monotonically from there

2. CLOCK_REALTIME:
	matches the current real-world time

The difference between the two clocks can be seen when the system time is adjusted
	 as a result of administrator action
	 tweaking by the network time protocol code
	  suspending and resuming the system.

In any of these situations, 
	CLOCK_MONOTONIC will tick forward as if nothing had happened
	CLOCK_REALTIME may see discontinuous changes.

Which clock to be used?
--------------------------

Depends mainly on whether the timer needs to be tied to time as the rest of the world sees it or not
