Return value of callback function
----------------------------------

HRTIMER_NORESTART	-  for a one-shot timer which should not be started again
HRTIMER_RESTART		-  for a recurring timer

In the restart case, the callback must set a new expiration time before returning.

Usually, restarting timers are used by kernel subsystems which need a callback at a regular interval.

The hrtimer code provides a function for advancing the expiration time to the next such interval:

unsigned long hrtimer_forward(struct hrtimer *timer, ktime_t now, ktime_t interval);

timer:      hrtimer to forward
now:        forward past this time
interval:   the interval to forward

Returns the number of overruns.
