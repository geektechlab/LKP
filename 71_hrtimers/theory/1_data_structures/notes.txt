Data Structures
-----------------

hrtimers live on a time-sorted linked list, with the next timer to expire being at the head of the list. 

A separate red/black tree is also used to enable the insertion and removal of timer events without scanning through the list

Header File: <linux/hrtimer.h> 

Data Structures: struct hrtimer

Implementation: kernel/time/hrtimer.c

Documentation: Documentation/timers/hrtimer.txt

struct hrtimer {
        struct timerqueue_node          node;
        ktime_t                         _softexpires;
        enum hrtimer_restart            (*function)(struct hrtimer *);
        struct hrtimer_clock_base       *base;
        u8                              state;
        u8                              is_rel;
        u8                              is_soft;
};

node is used to keep the timer on red-black tree
base points to the timer base
softexpires is expiration time
function is callback function
