Timer Implementation
----------------------

The kernel executes timers in bottom-half context, as softirqs, after the timer interrupt completes

The timer interrupt handler runs update_process_times(), which calls run_local_timers():

void run_local_timers(void)
{
	.....
	raise_softirq(TIMER_SOFTIRQ); /* raise the timer softirq */
}

The TIMER_SOFTIRQ softirq is handled by run_timer_softirq().This function runs all the expired timers (if any) on the current processor
