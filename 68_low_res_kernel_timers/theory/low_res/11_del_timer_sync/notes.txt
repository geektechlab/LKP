del_timer_sync
-------------

int del_timer_sync(struct timer_list *timer)

deactivate a timer and wait for the handler to finish
This function only differs from del_timer() on SMP

The function returns whether it has deactivated a pending timer or not.

Differences between del_timer and del_timer_sync
------------------------------------------------

guarantees that when it returns, the timer function is not running on any CPU

del_timer_sync is used to avoid race conditions on SMP systems as timers run asynchronously with respect to the currently executing code, several potential race conditions exist
