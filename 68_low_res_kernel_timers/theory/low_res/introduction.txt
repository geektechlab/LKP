Implementation of low resolution timers
---------------------------------------

Timers are organized on lists, and the following data structure represents a timer on a list:

Data Structure
------------------
struct timer_list;

Header File: <linux/timer.h>

Implementation: kernel/timer.c

struct timer_list {
        /*
         * All fields that change during normal runtime grouped to the
         * same cacheline
         */
        struct hlist_node       entry;
        unsigned long           expires;
        void                    (*function)(struct timer_list *);
        u32                     flags;
};

function saves a pointer to the callback function invoked upon time-out
expires specifies the time, in jiffies, at which the timer expires.

Use cases in Linux Kernel
--------------------------
Timers are used to detect when a device or a network peer has failed to respond within the expected time; when, as usual, the expected response does happen, the timer is canceled
