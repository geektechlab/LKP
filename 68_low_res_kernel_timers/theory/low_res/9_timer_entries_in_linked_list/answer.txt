Does kernel checks all the timer entries in linked list on each raise softirq?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The kernel partitions timers into five groups based on their expiration value.

Timers move down through the groups as their expiration time draws closer.

The partitioning ensures that, in most executions of the timer softirq, the kernel has to do little work to
find the expired timers.
