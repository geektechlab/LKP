Problems with low resolution timers
-------------------------------------

1. Low resolution timers  in Linux are only supported at a resolution of 1 jiffy
	The length of a jiffy is dependent on the value of HZ in the Linux kernel

2. Multimedia applications
	timer resolution of several milliseconds is not good enough
	need very precise timekeeping, for instance, to avoid frame skips in videos, or jumps during audio playback
