Different Architecture
==========================

The kernel build system allows you to specify a different architecture from the current system with the ARCH= argument

The build system also allows you to specify the specific compiler that you wish to use for the build by using the CC= argument or a cross-compile toolchain with the CROSS_COMPILE argument.

$ make ARCH=x86_64 defconfig

$ make ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=/usr/local/bin/arm-linux
