Building the Linux Kernel
=========================

To compile the Linux Kernel, run

$ make

Running make causes the kernel build system to use the configuration you have selected to build a kernel and all modules needed to support that configuration.

While the kernel is building, make displays the individual file names of what is currently happening, along with any build warnings or errors.

To build the kernel in a multithreaded way, use the -j option to the make program.

It is best to give a number to the -j option that corresponds to twice the number of processors in the system.

Example with four processors.

$ make -j8

Older kernel versions prior to 2.6 release required the additional step of 'make modules' to build all needed kernel modules. That is no longer needed.
