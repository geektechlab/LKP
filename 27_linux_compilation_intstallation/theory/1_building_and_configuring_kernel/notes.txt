Building Kernel
=========================

The process of building a kernel has two parts

	1. Configuring the kernel options
	2. Building the source with those options

Configuring Kernel
====================

The kernel configuration is kept in a file called .config in the top directory of the kernel source tree.

After downloading the sources, there will be no .config file, it needs to be created.

It can be created from
	1. Scratch
	2. Default configuration from a running kernel version ( it is present in /boot/config-`uname -r` )

Copying the configuration file of your distribution is the safest approach for the very first kernel install on any system.

Run the following command to generate a kernel configuration file based on the current configuration

$ make oldconfig

----
[ make oldconfig V=1 ]
----

The above command reads the existing .config file and prompts the user for options in the current kernel source that are not found in this file.
