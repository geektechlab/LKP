Installing the new kernel
==========================

Once the kernel compilation is complete, install the new kernel with:

$ sudo make modules_install

This will install all the modules that you have built and place them in the proper location in the filesystemfor the new kernel to properly find.

Modules are placed in the /lib/modules/kernel_version directory.

kernel_version is the kernel version of the new kernel you have just built.

After the modules have been successfully installed, the main kernel image must be installed.

$ sudo make install

The above command will perform the below steps:
===============================================

1. Kernel build system will verify that the kernel has been successfully built properly

2. Kernel build system will install the static kernel into the /boot directory and name it based on the kernel version

3. Any needed initial ramdisks images will be automatically created, using the modules that have been just installed during the modules_install phase

4. The bootloader program will be properly notified that a new kernel is present, and it will be added to the appropriate menu so the user can select it next time the machine is booted. ( for example, GRUB is updated ).

5. After this is finished, the kernel is successfully installed, and you can safely reboot and try out your new kernel image.

IMP Note: Installation does not overwrite older kernel images.
