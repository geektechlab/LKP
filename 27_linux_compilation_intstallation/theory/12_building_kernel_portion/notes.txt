Building Only a Portion of the Kernel
=====================================

Kernel build system allows you to easily build a portion of the kernel

For example, if you want to build the files in drivers/pci

$ make drivers/pci

The above command will not build the modules in that directory. To build modules

$ make M=drivers/pci

Finally execute 

$ make

to have the build system check all changed object files and do the final kernel image link properly.

To build only a particular module

$ make drivers/usb/serial/usb-serial.ko

The build system will build all needed files for the usb-serial.ko kernel module, and do the final link to create the module.
