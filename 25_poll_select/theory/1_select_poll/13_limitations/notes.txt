Problem with select
======================

What happens when i have file descriptors:1005, 1006 which i want to verify whether they are ready to read from.

I will call select with nfds of 1007 and the appropriate value of readfds.

Kernel gets a request from a user space program to monitor some file descriptors for reading.
It knows that the file descriptors are smaller than 1007, but that's all it knows.

To figure out which file descriptors the program is interested, the kernel needs to check all 1007 file descriptors, safely one by one.

Checking 1007 file descriptors when the program really only cares about two is quite inefficient.

What happens when the file descriptors were 10010 and 100019.

select() performs very poorly once the file descriptors get large.

----
maximum limit of file descriptor is [ uname -r ].
