Second Problem with select
===========================

How many file descriptors should fd_set be able to hold?

Ideally, it should be able to hold as many file descriptors as a process can have open.

$ ulimit -a

Traditionally, Linux allowed only 1,024 file descriptors per process, so this was reasonable.

FD_SETSIZE: macro is the maximum number of file descriptors that a fd_set object can hold information about.

From man page of select
========================

select() can monitor only file descriptors numbers that are less than FD_SETSIZE.

Executing FD_CLR() or FD_SET() with a value of fd that is negative or is equal to or larger than FD_SETSIZE will result in undefined behavior.

See Bugs section of select man page.
