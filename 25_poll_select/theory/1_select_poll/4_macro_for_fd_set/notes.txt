Macros for fd_set datatype
============================

	– FD_ZERO(fd_set *fdset);  // clear all bits in fdset

	– FD_SET(int fd, fd_set *fdset);  // turn on the bit for fd in fdset

	– FD_CLR(int fd, fd_set *fdset);   // turn off the bit for fd in fdset 

	– int FD_ISSET(int fd, fd_set *fdset);  // is the bit for fd on in fdset? 

Return
========

	select modifies the descriptor sets pointed to by the readset, writeset, and exceptset pointers. 

	When we call the function, we specify the values of the descriptors that we are interested in,

	 and on return, the result indicates which descriptors are ready

	We use the FD_ISSET macro on return to test a specific descriptor in an fd_set structure.

	Any descriptor that is not ready on return will have its corresponding bit cleared in the descriptor set. 

	The return value from this function indicates the total number of bits that are ready across all the descriptor sets. 

	If the timer value expires before any of the descriptors are ready, a value of 0 is returned.

	A return value of –1 indicates an error (which can happen, for example, if the function is interrupted by a caught signal).
