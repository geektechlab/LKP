How do i specify a non blocking I/O in linux through my user application
=========================================================================

Explicitly nonblocking I/O is indicated by the O_NONBLOCK flag in filp->f_flags.

Header File in user space : <fcntl.h>

Read:
===========
        No data is available, return -EAGAIN
        Data available, it is returned even if available data < requested data

Write:
===========
        No space is available in write buffer, return -EAGAIN
        Space available, it is written even if available space < requested write data
