Problem with Low res timers
-------------------------------

Low resolution timers  in Linux are only supported at a resolution of 1 jiffy.

The length of a jiffy is dependent on the value of HZ in the Linux kernel

It is 1 millisecond on i386 and some other platforms, and 10 milliseconds on most embedded platforms.

These are not suited for real-time applications.

High Resolution Timers
-------------------------

Introduced in kernel v2.6.16

Verify whether your kernel has support for High Res timers or not

$ cat /boot/config-`uname -r` | grep CONFIG_HIGH_RES_TIMERS

You can also examine the timer_list, and see whether specific clocks are listed as supporting high resolution

$ sudo cat /proc/timer_list | grep resolution

The .resolution entry must show 1 nsecs and the event_handler must show hrtimer_interrupts

Low Res timers are based on HZ(Jiffies), whereas High Res Timers based on ktime_t

Example of Low Resolution Timers: PIT
Example of High Resolution Timers: LAPIC
