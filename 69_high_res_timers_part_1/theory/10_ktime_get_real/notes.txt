ktime accessors
----------------

ktime_t ktime_get_real(void);

Header file: <linux/timekeeping.h>

Clock used: CLOCK_REALTIME

Returns the time in relative to the UNIX epoch starting in 1970 using the Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), same as gettimeofday() user space

Use cases: timestamps that need to persist across a reboot, like inode times

should be avoided for internal uses, since it can jump backwards due to 
	a leap second update, 
	NTP adjustment settimeofday() operation from user space
