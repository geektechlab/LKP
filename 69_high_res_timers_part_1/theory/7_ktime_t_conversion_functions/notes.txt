ktime_t conversion functions
----------------------------------

u64 ktime_to_ns(ktime_t kt);

/* Convert ktime_t to nanoseconds */
static inline s64 ktime_to_ns(const ktime_t kt)
{
        return kt;
}

Direct interpretation of a ktime_t as a number of nanoseconds would be possible on 64-bit machines, 
but can lead to problems on 32-bit machines . Thus, the function ktime_to_ns is provided to perform the conversion properly.
