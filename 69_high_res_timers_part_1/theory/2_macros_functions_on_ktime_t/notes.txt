Macros/functions on ktime_t
------------------------------

A whole set of functions and macros has been provided for working with ktime_t values

There are two ways of initializing them

1. DEFINE_KTIME(name);   /* Initialize to zero */ (not present)

2. ktime_t kt;
   kt = ktime_set(long secs, long nanosecs);

static inline ktime_t ktime_set(const s64 secs, const unsigned long nsecs)
{
        if (unlikely(secs >= KTIME_SEC_MAX))
                return KTIME_MAX;

        return secs * NSEC_PER_SEC + (s64)nsecs;
}

Return the ktime_t representation of the value
