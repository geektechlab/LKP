ktime_t
----------

Data structure used to store a time value in nanoseconds.

Header File : <linux/ktime.h>

On 64-bit systems, a ktime_t is really just a 64-bit integer value in nanoseconds

typedef s64     ktime_t;

On 32-bit machines, however, it is a two-field structure:
	one 32-bit value holds the number of seconds
	and the other holds nanoseconds.
	
	The order of the two fields depends on whether the host architecture is big-endian or not

	they are always arranged so that the two values can, when needed, be treated as a single, 64-bit value
