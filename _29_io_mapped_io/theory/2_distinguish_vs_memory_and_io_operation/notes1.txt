On X86 machine, we have a separate pin IO/M.

This pin is used to distinguish between memory and I/O operations.

High = I/O operation

Low = Memory Operation.

When you use IN/OUT Instructions, the IO/M pin is high, so the memory doesn't respond and I/O chip does.

When you use LOAD/STORE Instructions, the IO/M pin is low, and the memory responds and I/O devices stay out of communication.
