Address Bus: Identify the source or destination of data.

Data Bus:    Carries data

Control Bus: control and timing information ( Read/Write, Clock signals)

How Memory Addressing Works (Simplified Version)
====================================================

1. CPU puts the address of memory on the address bus

2. Sets the control signal indicating read/write operation.

3. Data is placed by the corresponding memory chip on the data bus.

Now a days, this is handled by the memory controller. CPU communicates with the memory controller

We also have I/O devices: 

	1. Serial Port
	2. Parallel Port
	3. Keyboard
	4. Mouse
