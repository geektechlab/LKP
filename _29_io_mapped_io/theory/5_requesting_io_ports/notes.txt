Requesting I/O Ports
====================

Accessing I/O Ports is simple.

Detecting which I/O ports have been assigned to I/O devices may not be easy.

Often a device driver must blindly write into some I/O port to probe the hardware device.

If this I/O port is used by some other hardware device, system crash could occur.

To prevent such situations, the kernel keeps track of I/O ports assigned to each hardware device by means of "resources". (struct resource)

To get exclusive access to the I/O Ports.

struct resource *request_region(unsigned long first, unsigned long n,
                                const char *name);
Header File: #include <linux/ioport.h>

Return Value: non-NULL if the allocation succeeds.
	      NULL on failure

To release a reserved region one must use the release_region() function

void release_region(unsigned long start, unsigned long n);

cat /proc/ioports will give information about all I/O addresses currently assigned to I/O devices.
