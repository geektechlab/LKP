All peripheral(I/O) devices are controlled by writing and reading its registers. 

Most of the time a device has several registers, and they are accessed at consecutive addresses, either in the memory address space or in the I/O address space

Each I/O device has minimum the below registers:

a data register (either readable or writable, depending on whether it is an input or output device)
a control register (writable, for controlling device operation)
a status register (readable, for determining device status -- in particular, whether it is ready to receive or provide data)

More complex devices (e.g., disks) will have multiple control and status registers
