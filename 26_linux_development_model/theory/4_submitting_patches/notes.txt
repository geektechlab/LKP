Submitting Patches
===================

The development process itself happens entirely over emails. 

Every kernel subsystem has a mailing list. 

Patches touching a specific driver/subsystem are sent to the maintainer listed in MAINTAINER. The MAINTAINER file consists of subsystem git information and mailing lists for each of the subsystem.

Contributors send patches to mailing lists through email

While sending the patch, carbon copy (cc) to  linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org (Linux Kernel Mailing List)

Subject of the mail: "[PATCH] brief description"

Body of the mail: Technical details of your changes patch makes and reasons behind those changes

Add Kernel version to the email.

Attach the patch as plain text 

Note: If your patch is large or contains several logical changes, you should break the patch into chunks with each chunk representing a logical change.

Each Email should send one patch
