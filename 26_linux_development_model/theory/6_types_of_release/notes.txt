Types of Releases
===================

1. Prepatch/RC:
	Mainline kernel pre-releases
	Contains new features which must be tested before they can put into a stable release
	Maintained and released by Linus Torvalds

	https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/refs/tags?h=v5.4-rc6

2. Mainline:
	Maintained by Linus Torvalds
	Tree where all the new features are introduced.
	New mainline kernels are released every 2-3 months

3. Stable:
	After each mainline kernel is released, it is considered "stable."
	Any bug fixes for a stable kernel are backported from the mainline tree and applied by a designated stable kernel maintainer.
	Stable kernel updates are released on as-needed basis, usually once a week.
	There are usually only a few bugfix kernel releases until next mainline kernel becomes available

4. LongTerm:
	Stable releases are selected for long term maintenance to provide critical bug fixes for older kernel trees

How long the stable kernels are maintained?
===========================================

Stable kernels are maintained for as long as the current development cycle is happening.
After Linus releases a new kernel, the previous stable kernel release tree is stopped and users must move to the newer released kernel.
