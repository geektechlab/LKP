Linux Kernel Release Cycle
===========================

1. Linus Torvalds releases a new kernel and opens a 2-week merge window.

2. Subsystem maintainers collects patches ahead of time and send them to Linus during this merge window.

3. Nearly 10,000 patches get pulled into linus's tree during these 2 weeks.

4. At the end of two weeks Linus declares the merge window has closed ande releases the first release candidate known as rc1.

5. At this point, the release cycle moves into a bug fixes-only mode, with a series of release candidate(rc) from Linus.

6. Every week a new rc is released with the name 5.12.rc1, 5.12.rc2, and so on.

7. Finally after the end of these rc weeks the kernel is stable and ready for release as version 5.12.

8. The whole development is a matter of 10-12 weeks and we get a new version in every three months.
