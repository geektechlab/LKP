Linux Kernel Trees
=====================

What is Linux Kernel Tree?
=============================

The Linux Kernel source-tree is a directory which contains all of the kernel source.
You could build a new kernel, install that, and reboot your machine to use the rebuilt kernel. 

There are several main and susbsystem git repositories of Linux Trees.

https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/

The above link lists all the trees present.

Mainline Kernel Tree
=====================

Maintained by Linus Torvalds.
This is the tree where Linux releases mainline kernels and RC releases

Stable Tree
==============

Maintained by Greg Kroah-Hartman.
This tree consists of stable release branches.
Stable releases are based on this tree.

linux-next Tree
===============

Maintained by Stephen Rothwell
Before updates from subsystem trees are merged into the mainline tree, they need to be integration-tested.
This tree is used for integration testing.

Staging Tree
===========

Used to hold stand-alone drivers and filesystems that are not ready to be merged into main portion of
Linux Kernel tree at this point due to coding standards or quality issues.

Resolves the "hundreds of different download sites" problem that most out-of-tree drivers had in past

Location: drivers/staging folder

the linux-next tree contains the latest version of the staging tree
