Developers, Maintainers in Linux Kernel
===========================================

Most parts of the kernel have an associated maintainer.

The maintainer is the individual (or individuals) who is in charge of specific parts of the kernel.

Example:

1. Each individual driver has an associated maintainer

2. Each Kernel subsystem for example networking subsystem also has an associated maintainer. Subsystems may have multiple maintainers..

Examples of subsystems:

	a) Memory Management
	b) Networking
	c) scheduling
	d) USB
	e) PCI

These maintainers decide which patch goes to the mainline kernel

The maintainer for a specific driver or subsystem is usually listed in the file MAINTAINERS, which is also located in the root of the kernel source tree.

There is a special type of maintainer known as the kernel maintainer. This individual actually maintains the kernel tree.
