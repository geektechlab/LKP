list_for_each_entry
=================

Most kernel code uses the list_for_each_entry() macro to iterate over a linked list.

This macro handles the work performed by list_entry(), making list iteration simple.

/**
 * list_for_each_entry  -       iterate over list of given type
 * @pos:        the type * to use as a loop cursor.
 * @head:       the head for your list.
 * @member:     the name of the list_head within the struct.
 */
#define list_for_each_entry(pos, head, member)                          \
        for (pos = list_first_entry(head, typeof(*pos), member);        \
             &pos->member != (head);                                    \
             pos = list_next_entry(pos, member))
