list_for_each
=================

/**
 * list_for_each        -       iterate over a list
 * @pos:        the &struct list_head to use as a loop cursor.
 * @head:       the head for your list.
 */
#define list_for_each(pos, head) \
        for (pos = (head)->next; pos != (head); pos = pos->next)

This macro takes two parameters: both list_head structures

First: pointer to point to the current entry. it is a temporary variable that you must provide.
second: head node of the list you want to traverse.

struct list_head *p;
list_for_each(p, listhead) {
	//p points to an entry in the list
}
