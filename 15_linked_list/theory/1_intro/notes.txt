Linked Lists
===================

Linked list is the simplest and most common data structure in the Linux Kernel.

Linked list allows to have variable number of elements called nodes of the list.

Elements in Linked List are dynamically created at run time, and they do not necessarily occupy contiguous regions in memory.

Therefore elements needs to be linked together. Each element in the list contains a pointer to the next element.

As elements are added and removed from the list, the pointer to the next node is simply adjusted.

Types

1. Singly Linked Lists
2. Doubly Linked Lists
3. Circular Linked Lists
