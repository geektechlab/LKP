Deleting a node from Linked List
==================================

To delete a node from a linked list, use list_del.

static inline void list_del(struct list_head *entry)
{
        __list_del_entry(entry);
        entry->next = LIST_POISON1;
        entry->prev = LIST_POISON2;
}

Note: This does not free any memory; this function merely removes the element from the list.
After calling this, you would typically destroy your data structure.
