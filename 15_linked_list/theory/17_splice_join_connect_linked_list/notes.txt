Splicing/Joining/connecting Linked lists
=========================================

To splice two unconnected lists together.

list_splice(struct list_head *list, struct list_head *head);

This function splices together two lists by inserting the list pointed to by 'list' to the given list after the element 'head'.

To splice two unconnected lists together and reinitialize the old list.

list_splice_init(struct list_head *list, struct list_head);

This function works the same as list_splice(), except that the emptied list pointed to by 'list' is reinitialized
