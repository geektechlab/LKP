PCI Configuration Space
========================

Each PCI Device has a set of registers referred to as configuration space.

Size of the Configuration space is 256 bytes.

First 64 bytes (0x00 - 0x3f) are standardized

Next 192 bytes (0x40 - 0xff) are vendor specific

Registers 0x00, 0x01 are defined by PCI spec as vendor ID (16-Bit)
Registers 0x02, 0x03 are defined by PCI spec as product ID (16-Bit)

Vendor ID identifies the manufacturer of the device.

	Allocated by the PCI SIG to ensure each is unique 

Device ID identifies the particular device, set by the vendor
