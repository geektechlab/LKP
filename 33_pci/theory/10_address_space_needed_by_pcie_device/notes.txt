How do you determine the amount of address space needed by a PCI device?
=========================================================================

A Base Address is half the information thatâ€™s needed 

We need to get the size of the device.

1. you must save the original value of the BAR
2. write a value of all 1's to the register
3. then read it back
4. restore the original value.

The amount of memory can then be determined by masking the information bits, performing a bitwise NOT ('~' in C), and incrementing the value by 1
