PCI Express 
============

The PCI Express bus extends the Configuration Space from 256 bytes to 4096 bytes.

This extended configuration space *cannot* be accessed using the legacy PCI method (through ports 0xCF8 and 0xCFC)

The enhanced configuration mechanism makes use of memory mapped address space range/s to access PCI configuration space.

On x86 and x64 platforms, the address of each memory area is determined by the ACPI 'MCFG' table
