Create a file within debugfs
=============================

struct dentry *debugfs_create_file(const char *name, umode_t mode,
				       struct dentry *parent, void *data,
				       const struct file_operations *fops);

name -> Name of the file to create

mode -> access permissions the file should have

parent -> the directory which should hold the file

data -> will be stored in the i_private field of the resulting inode structure

fops -> set of file operations which implement the file's behavior

At a minimum, the read() and/or write() operations should be provided; others can be included as needed.

Return Value:
==============

Success: dentry pointer to the created file
Failure: ERR_PTR(-ERROR)
