Why can't i use printk instead of putting data into debugfs?
============================================================

Sometimes putting in a few printk() calls is sufficient, but, often, that is not the best way to go

The debugging information may only be useful occasionally, but the printed output clogs up the logs all the time.

Using printk() also does not help if the developer wishes to be able to change values from user space.
