Debugfs code provides a number of helper functions for simple situations

If you need to write to and read from a single value, you can use this to create an unsigned 8-bit value:

struct dentry *debugfs_create_u8(const char *name, mode_t mode, struct dentry *parent, u8 *value);

name - a pointer to a string containing the name of the file to create.

mode - the permission that the file should have

parent - a pointer to the parent dentry for this file

value  - a pointer to a variable that needs to be read and written to.

A few other helper functions to create files with single integer values are

    struct dentry *debugfs_create_u16(const char *name, umode_t mode,
				      struct dentry *parent, u16 *value);
    struct dentry *debugfs_create_u32(const char *name, umode_t mode,
				      struct dentry *parent, u32 *value);
    struct dentry *debugfs_create_u64(const char *name, umode_t mode,
				      struct dentry *parent, u64 *value);

Implementation: fs/debugfs/file.c
