debugfs
===========

debugfs helps kernel developers export large amounts of debug data into user-space.

procfs  - Used for information about process
sysfs   - Has strict one-value-per-file rule
debugfs - no rules, any information can be placed by developers

CONFIG_DEBUG_FS
==============

To compile a Linux kernel with the debugfs facility, the CONFIG_DEBUG_FS option must be set to yes.

$ cat /boot/config-`uname -r` | grep CONFIG_DEBUG_FS

Mounting debugfs
================

$ mount | grep debugfs

If debugfs is not already mounted, you can mount it with the below command,

$ mount -t debugfs none /sys/kernel/debug

Note:
========
1. Debugfs directory is accessible to only root user by default, can be changed with uid/gid/mode options while mounting

2. Can be used by only GPL Modules
