Creating a proc file
========================

Header File: <linux/proc_fs.h>

static inline struct proc_dir_entry *proc_create(const char *name, 
						 umode_t mode,
						 struct proc_dir_entry *parent, 
						 const struct file_operations *proc_fops);

name: The name of the proc entry
mode: The access mode for proc entry
parent: The name of the parent directory under /proc
proc_fops: The structure in which the file operations for the proc entry will be created.

Removing a proc entry:
=============================

When a module is removed from the kernel, it should also remove any proc entries it created.

The function that enables the removal of proc entry is "remove_proc_entry" which has the following prototype
void remove_proc_entry(const char *name, struct proc_dir_entry *parent);

name: Name of the proc entry that has to be removed.
parent: In case the proc entry lies in a subdirectory under the proc filesystem, we can pass the subdirectories here.
