Proc File System
===================

Proc is a pseudo file system for interfacing with the kernel internal data structures.

As a user, you can use proc files for system diagnostics  â€“ CPU, memory, Interrupts and many more.

You can also configure a lot of parameters like scheduler parameters, kernel objects, memory and more

The common interaction with proc is using cat and echo from the shell. For example:
# cat /proc/cpuinfo
# echo "50"> /proc/sys/kernel/sched_rr_timeslice_ms
