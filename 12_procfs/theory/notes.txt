Virtual File Systems
=======================

There are numerous ways for a device driver (or other kernel component) to provide information to the user or system administrator.  

One useful technique is the creation of virtual files, in debugfs, /proc or elsewhere.

Virtual files can provide human-readable output that is easy to get at without any special utility programs

virtual file system reside in RAM memeory. They do not take any space in harddisk or any storage media. /proc/ /debugfs and /sys file systems are example of this. But SATA etc. take space in storage media.
