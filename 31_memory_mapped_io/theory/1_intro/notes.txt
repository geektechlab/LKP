I/O Memory
==================

The most widely supported form of IO is memory mapped IO.

A part of the CPUâ€™s address space is interpreted not as accesses to memory, but as accesses to a device

Some architectures define devices to be at a fixed address, but most have some method of discovering devices.

Advantage of memory mapped I/O is that it keeps the instruction set small.

Logic of creating separate I/O address space initially because the memory address space of processors was quite limited.

When x86 moved to 32-bit, the address space was still same 64KB, even after it moved to 64-bit.

Examples of I/O Memory:
---------------------

a) Holding Video Data
b) Ethernet Packets
c) Device Registers
