==========================

devmem is a small program that reads and writes from physical memory using /dev/mem

Usage: devmem ADDRESS [WIDTH [VALUE]]

Read/write from physical address

    ADDRESS Address to act upon
    WIDTH   Width (8/16/...)
    VALUE   Data to be written

$ devmem 0x00000000 8

$ devmem 0x00000000 16

$ devmem 0x00000000 32

UART0 is mapped: 0x101f1000. 

The code that emulates the serial port inside QEMU implements a subset of the functionalities of the PL011 Prime Cell UART from ARM

UARTDR register that is used to transmit (when writing in the register) and receive (when reading) bytes; this register is placed at offset 0x0

$ devmem 0x101f1000 8 0x61

On Ubuntu
