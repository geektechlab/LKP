CONFIG_STRICT_DEVMEM
=====================

Since Linux 2.6.26, and depending on the architecture, the CONFIG_STRICT_DEVMEM kernel configuration option limits the areas which can be accessed through /dev/mem

# cat /boot/config-`uname -r` | grep CONFIG_STRICT_DEVMEM

It is enabled by default x86/x86_64 and ARM platforms.

Enabling CONFIG_STRICT_DEVMEM implements strict access to /dev/mem so that it only allows user-space access to memory mapped peripherals.

With this option disabled, the root user from user-space can access all kernel and user-space memory through /dev/mem.

Try with qemu-system-arm

The QEMU emulator supports the VersatilePB platform, that contains an ARM926EJ-S core

Memory map can be read : cat /proc/iomem
