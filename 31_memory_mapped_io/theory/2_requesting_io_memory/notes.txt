Requesting I/O Memory
=======================

Functions equivalent to request_region() and release_region(), but for I/O memory

struct resource *request_mem_region(
		unsigned long start,
		unsigned long len,
		char *name);

void release_mem_region(
		unsigned long start,
		unsigned long len);

request_mem_region:

	---> Informs kernel that your driver is going to use this range of I/O addresses

	---> This prevents other drivers from using it through request_mem_region

cat /proc/iomem lists all the kernel drivers requested 'request_mem_region'
