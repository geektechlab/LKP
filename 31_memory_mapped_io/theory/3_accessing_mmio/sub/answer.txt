Why do we need to call ioread instructions why can't i directly access by dereferencing?
=========================================================================================

Compiler can perform optimizations

For example, the below logic:

if (x)
	y = *ptr

Can be converted to 

tmp = *ptr;
if (x)
	y = tmp

Another example,
*reg  = 1; *reg = 2;

will be converted to 

*reg = 2;

MMIO registers will have side effects, so you must force the compiler to avoid optimizations by using volatile and avoid hardware caching using barriers. ioread functions internally perform these operations.
