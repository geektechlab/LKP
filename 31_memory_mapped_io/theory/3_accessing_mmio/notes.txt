Can we access(read/write) MMIO memory directly?
==================================================

No, we can't . Kernel is running in virtual address space.

Like user space, the kernel accesses memory through page tables

So, when kernel code needs to access memory-mapped I/O devices, it must first set up an appropriate kernel page-table mapping.

void *ioremap(unsigned long phys_addr, unsigned long size);
void iounmap(void * addr);

A successful call to ioremap() returns a kernel virtual address corresponding to start of the requested physical address range.

Return address of ioremap is not normally meant to be dereferenced directly, though, for a number of (often architecture-specific) reasons.

Functions to read and write data using memory mapped by ioremap()
=================================================================

unsigned int ioread8(void *addr);
unsigned int ioread16(void *addr);
unsigned int ioread32(void *addr);

void iowrite8(u8 value, void *addr);
void iowrite16(u16 value, void *addr);
void iowrite32(u32 value, void *addr);
