Hardware Random Number Generator
=================================

Device that generates random numbers from a physical process.

The Intel 82802 Firmware Hub (FWH) chip included a hardware RNG.

The RNG is dedicated hardware that harnesses system thermal noise to generate random and indeterministic values.

Registers
==============

1. Hardware Status ( 0xFFBC015F )

	used to determine whether or not an RNG device is present on the Firmware Hub
	If present, whether it is enabled for use

	Bit Mask 				Description
	====================================================
	0x40 (Bit 6 – read only) RNG Present: 
						If this bit is read as 1, an RNG is present on the Firmware Hub device. 
						If it is read as 0, the RNG is absent.

	0x01 (Bit 0 – read/write) RNG Enabled: 

						This bit indicates whether or not the RNG is enabled. 
						If the bit is set to 1, the RNG will generate random data.
						 If this bit is 0, the RNG is disabled.
