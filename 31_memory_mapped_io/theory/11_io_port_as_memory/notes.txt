Ports as I/O Memory
=====================

Linux kernel provides a function ioport_map which maps I/O ports and make them appear as I/O Memory.

void *ioport_map(unsigned long port, unsigned int count);

To unmap:

void ioport_unmap(void *addr);

Note: I/O Ports must still be allocated with request_region before they can be remapped in this way.
