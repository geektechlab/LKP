Write operation:
----------------
Writers must take out exclusive access before making changes to the protected data.

write_seqlock(&the_lock);
/* Make changes here */
write_sequnlock(&the_lock);

write_seqlock() locks the spinlock and increments the sequence number.
write_sequnlock() increments the sequence number again, then releases the spinlock.
