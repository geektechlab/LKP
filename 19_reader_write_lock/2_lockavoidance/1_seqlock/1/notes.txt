seqlocks/sequence locks
========================

Added in Linux 2.6

Objective: Provide Fast and lock-free access to shared resources.


Differences between reader-writer locks and sequence locks
------------------------------------------------------------

	--> Writer is given a higher priority when compared to reader

	--> Writer is allowed to modify the shared data, even when there are readers in critical section


How readers handle the data corruption when writer updates it during read?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

	Readers are in charge to check if they read valid data.

	If a write access took place while the data was read, the data is invalid and has to be read again.

	Identification of write accesses is realized with  a counter


What happens when a writer is already in critical section and another writer arrives
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	A writer uses a spinlock for mutual exclusion and hence will not interfere the other writer.

When to use
-------------

	A small amount of data is to be protected

	Your data has a lot of readers/frequently accessed

	Your data has a few writers

	It is important that writers not be starved for access
