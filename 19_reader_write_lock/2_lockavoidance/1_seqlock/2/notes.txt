How it works
===============

It uses
       Sequence Counter (Integer)
       Spin lock



Data structure: seqlock_t

Header File: linux/seqlock.h

typedef struct seqcount {
        unsigned sequence;
} seqcount_t;


typedef struct {
        struct seqcount seqcount;
        spinlock_t lock;
} seqlock_t;


	seqcount -> sequence counter
	lock     -> lock to atomic update in case of writers

Initialization
----------------

        Static:         DEFINE_SEQLOCK(x)

        Dynamic:        seqlock_init(x)
