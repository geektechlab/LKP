Jiffies Wraparound
======================

The jiffies variable, like any C integer experiences overflow when its value is increased beyond its maximum storage limit.

For a 32-bit unsigned integer, the maximum value is 2^32 - 1.

When the tick count is equal to the maximum and it is incremented, it wraps around to zero.

What happens if jiffies wrapped back to zero after setting timeout?

unsigned long timeout = jiffies + 10 * HZ;

if (timeout  > jiffies) 

Then the first condition will fail because the jiffies value would be smaller than timeout despite logically being larger.
