How -300*HZ wraps 5 minutes after boot
===========================================

HZ is the number of clock ticks (jiffies) in 1 second.

300 seconds is 5 minutes.

Therefore 300 x HZ is the number of jiffies in 5 minutes.

Therefore after 5 minutes, an initial value of -300 * HZ will have been incremented to 0.
