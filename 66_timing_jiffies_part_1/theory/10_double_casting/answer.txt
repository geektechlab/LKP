Why do we have double casting in the below code

#define INITIAL_JIFFIES ((unsigned long)(unsigned int) (-300*HZ))

the negative signed int (-300*HZ) is converted to an unsigned int with sign extension to whatever size an unsigned int is on that implementation (typically 32 bits)

then the second cast (to unsigned long) casts that up to the size of an unsigned long (32 or 64 bits depending on implementation) with zero extension

In the case of 32 bit unsigned long, the second (leftmost) cast does nothing

In the case of 64 bit unsigned long, the second cast would cause the upper 32 bits to be set to 0.
