Minimal Linux with QEMU/Busybox
===============================

QEMU (short for Quick Emulator) is a free and open-source  hypervisor that performs hardware virtualization.

Busybox : combines tiny versions of many common UNIX utilities into a single small executable.
	  BusyBox provides a fairly complete environment for any small or embedded system.
	  Note: The utilities in BusyBox generally have fewer options than their full-featured GNU cousins

How it is useful?
====================

Building a minimal Linux kernel and booting it on an emulator allows developers to quickly build additional Linux kernel features.

Build Busybox
=============

Step 1: Download busybox from their website : https://busybox.net/

	$ wget https://busybox.net/downloads/busybox-1.31.0.tar.bz2

Step 2: Extract the sources.

	$ tar xvf busybox-1.31.0.tar.bz2

Step 3: The busybox build system supports O= means “place build output here”.
	This allows you to host multiple different configurations out of the same source tree. 

	$ cd busybox-1.31.0
	$ mkdir -pv build
	$ make O=build defconfig

Step 4: We need to statically link busybox in order to avoid fiddling with shared libraries.
	$ make O=build menuconfig

	Settings -> Build Options -> Build Static Binary

Step 5: Compile/Install busybox

	$ cd build
	$ time make -j8
	$ time make install

Step 6: Now, build/_install directory will have a directory structure with all the unix tools.
