initrd vs initramfs
===================

initrd (initial ramdisk) is a scheme for loading a temporary root file system into memory, which may be used as part of the Linux startup process.

initrd and initramfs refer to two different methods of achieving this.

Both are commonly used to make preparations before the real root file system can be mounted.

An image of this initial root file system (along with the kernel image) must be stored somewhere accessible by the Linux bootloader or the boot firmware of the computer.

The bootloader will 
	load the kernel,
	initial root file system image into memory and 
	then start the kernel

At the end of its boot sequence, the kernel tries to determine the format of the image from its first few blocks of data, which can lead either to the initrd or initramfs scheme.

In the initramfs scheme (available since the Linux kernel 2.6.13), the image is a cpio archive (optionally compressed).

cpio - copy in and out

The archive is unpacked by the kernel into a special instance of a tmpfs that becomes the initial root file system

the kernel executes /init as its first process that is not expected to exit.
