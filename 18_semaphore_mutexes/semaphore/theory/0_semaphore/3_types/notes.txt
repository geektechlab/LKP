Types of Semaphore
=====================

Spin locks allow only one task to hold the lock at a time.

With semaphores,number of tasks to hold the lock at a time can be specified while initializing/declaring semaphore

    This value is called as usage count or simply count.

Count = 1   --> Binary Sempahore
                Used for mutual exclusion

Count > 1   --> Counting Semaphore
