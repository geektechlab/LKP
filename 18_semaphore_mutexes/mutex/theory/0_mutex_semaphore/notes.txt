Mutexes
===========

Almost all semaphores found in the Linux kernel are used for mutual exclusion by count of 1.

Using semaphore for mutual exclusion is overhead, so kernel provides a new interface: mutex

The mutex subsystem checks and enforces the following rules:

	Only one task can hold the mutex at a time

	Whoever locked a mutex must unlock it.

	That is you cannot lock a mutex in one context and unlock in another

	Recursive locks and unlocks are not allowed

	Process cannot exit while holding a mutex

	Mutex cannot be acquired from an interrupt handler
