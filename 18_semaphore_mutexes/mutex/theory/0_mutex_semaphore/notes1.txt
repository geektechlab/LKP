Differences between mutexes and semaphores
===========================================

What happens when a process tries to acquire a mutex lock?

        When acquiring a mutex, there are three possible paths that can be taken

                1. Fast Path
                2. Mid Path
                3. Slow Path

        The path which will be taken depends on the state of the mutex.

Fast Path:

        Taken when no process has acquired the mutex

Mid Path:

        When the mutex is not available, it tries to go for mid path. also called as optimistic spinning.

        This path will be only executed if there are no other processes ready to run having high priority and the owner of mutex is running.

        In this path, tries to spin using MCS lock hoping the owner will release the lock soon.

        Avoids expensive context switch

Slow Path:

        last resort.

        This path acts as a semaphore lock

        If the lock is unable to be acquired by the process, the task is added to wait queue

        It sleeps until woken up by the unlock path.
