GPIO Registers on Raspberry Pi3
================================

$ sudo cat /proc/iomem | grep gpio

Look into Chapter 6 of  SoC documentation

On the Pi2/Pi3, memory mapped I/O starts at 0x3f000000

The GPIO base is at 0x3f200000 (the documentation confusingly lists it as 0x7e200000, just replace the leading 0x7e with 0x3f)
