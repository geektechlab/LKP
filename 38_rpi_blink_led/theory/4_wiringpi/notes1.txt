Setting pin as input/output
===========================

GPFSEL register allows you to set a particular functionality of GPIO Pin.(input/output/alternate functionality)

GPFSEL registers are organised per 10 pins.

So one 32-bit register contains the setup bits for 10 pins.

GPFSEL0 -- GPIO0  -  GPIO9
GPFSEL1 -- GPIO10 -  GPIO19
...
...
...
GPFSEL5 -- GPIO50 - GPIO53

To get the gpf address of a particular pin = GPFSEL0 Address + (pin/10)
Example for GPI012 = GPFSEL0 Address + 1 = GPFSEL1 Address

There are three GPFSEL bits per pin
000 = GPIO Pin x is an input
001 = GPIO Pin x is an output
100 = GPIO Pin x takes alternate function 0
101 = GPIO Pin x takes alternate function 1
110 = GPIO Pin x takes alternate function 2
111 = GPIO Pin x takes alternate function 3
011 = GPIO Pin x takes alternate function 4
010 = GPIO Pin x takes alternate function 5

Location of these three bits for each GPIO Pin can be calculated by (pin%10)*3
Example for GPIO12 = (12%10)*3 = 2 * 3 = 6 (Bits 6 to 8)
