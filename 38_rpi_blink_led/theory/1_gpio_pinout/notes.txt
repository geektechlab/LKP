GPIO (General Purpose Input Output)
===================================

The Raspberry Pi 3 boards (all models: 3A+, 3B, 3B+) have a GPIO header with 40 pins

GPIO Voltage
-------------

All GPIOs work at 3.3V.

Outputs
-----------

A GPIO pin designated as an output pin can be set to high (3V3) or low (0V).

Inputs
-----------

A GPIO pin designated as an input pin can be read as high (3V3) or low (0V).
This is made easier with the use of internal pull-up or pull-down resistors.

Pinout in terminal
-----------------------

pinout command provides a handy reference to access the rpi pinout from terminal

$ sudo apt install python3-gpiozero

$ pinout
