Blinking LED
============

You need:
-----------

        ---> Breadboard

        ---> LED

        ---> 330 Ohm resistor

        ---> Two Male-Female Jumper Wires

Why Resistor?
-------------------

You must ALWAYS use resistors to connect LEDs up to the GPIO pins of the Raspberry Pi.

The Raspberry Pi can only supply a small current (about 60mA).

The LEDs will want to draw more, and if allowed to they will burn out the Raspberry Pi.

Therefore putting the resistors in the circuit will ensure that only this small current will flow and the Raspberry Pi will not be damaged.

Connections
---------------

First identify which is the anode and cathode,the shorter leg is the cathode(negative) and longer leg is anode(positive).

Connect the anode to resistor and then to GPIO pin
Connect Cathode to Ground
