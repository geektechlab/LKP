Printing Device Numbers
=========================

Kernel provides a couple of utility macros to print device numbers.

Header File: <linux/kdev_t.h>

int print_dev_t(char *buffer, dev_t dev);

char *format_dev_t(char *buffer, dev_t dev);

Both macros encode the device number into the given buffer; the only difference is print_dev_t returns the number of characters printed, while format_dev_t returns buffer;

The buffer size should be atleast 20 bytes.
