Differences between ctags and cscope
======================================

Differences between two are small

1. With ctags, you can use autocomplete for function/variable names. cscope doesn't provide this feature

2. ctags allows you to jump from function calls to their definitions using ctrl + ]. There are no key bindings for cscope by default, you need to add it manually in ~/.vimrc file

3. cscope allows you to list all the instances where a function is called.

4. Cscope is great for bigger, unknown code bases.
