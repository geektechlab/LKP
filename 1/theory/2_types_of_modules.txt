Types of Modules
===================

1. In-Source Tree: Modules present in the Linux Kernel Source Code ( these are present in the linux kernel source code so we download the source code from kernel.org can be configured as kernel modules )

2. Out-of-Tree: Modules not present in the Linux Kernel Source Code. ( are not part of the kernel source code and which are distributed separately which by the vendor )

All modules start out as "out-of-tree" developments, that can be compiled using the context of a source-tree. 

Once a module gets accepted to be included, it becomes an in-tree module.
