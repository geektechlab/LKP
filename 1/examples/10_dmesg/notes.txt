Linux dmesg command Tutorial 
=======================================

==========================
What does dmesg command do?
==========================

Kernel keeps all the logs in a ring buffer.

This is done to avoid the boot logs being getting lost until the syslog daemon starts and collects them and stores them in /var/log/dmesg.

We will loss the boot up logs if we don't store them in ring buffer.

dmesg command is used to control or print kernel ring buffer. Default is to prints messages from the kernel ring buffer on to console.

( we can check by strace dmesg -> it will write to STDOUT )

==========================
Important dmesg commands:
==========================

1. Clear Ring buffer: 
	
	$dmesg -c -> Will clear the ring buffer after printing
	$dmesg -C -> Will clear the ring buffer but does not prints on the console.

2. Don't Print Timestamps: 

	$dmesg -t -> Will not print timestamps

3. Restrict dmesg command to list of levels.

	$ dmesg -l err,warn will print only error and warn messages

4. Print human readable timestamps:

	$dmesg -T will print timestamps in readable format. Note: Timestamp could be inaccurate.

5. Display the log level in the output:

	$dmesg -x will add loglevel to the output.

6. You can combine options, so dmesg -Tx will print both human readable time and loglevel.

-----------------------

when the kernel boots, there is no root file system. This means it does not have capability to write to any file so that's the reason why dmesg stores contents in a ring buffer. Once the system is up, syslog daemon starts and it will collect contents of the ring buffer and store them in a file which is specific to the distribution.

So, if you look into the process list we'll be seeing there's a syslog daemon running ( check by [ ps -ef | grep syslog ] ) so which is actually reading periodically reading the kernel buffer contents of kernel buffer and it's writing into some file in /var/log which depends on the distribution ( check by [ cat /var/log/kern.log ] ).
