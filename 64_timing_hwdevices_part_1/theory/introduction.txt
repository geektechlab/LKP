Timing Measurements in Linux Kernel
=====================================
Many computer activities are based on timing measurements.

E.g. Your Computer display is turned off, if you have not pressed a key or moved your mouse for a particular time.

Linux timing subsystem mainly handles two types of timing activities

	1. Keeping the current time and date
		a. time() , gettimeofday() and clock_gettime()
		b. Time stamps for files and network packets

	2. Maintaining Timers
		a. Mechanisms to notify kernel and user space (ex. alarm()) that a certain interval of time has elapsed.

Hardware Devices
================
Linux depends on hardware devices to maintain time. These devices can be basically classified into two types:

	1. Clocks/Counters:  provide precise time measurements
		Used to keep track of current time of day
	2. Timers: Issue interrupts at fixed, predefined frequency.
		Used for implementing software timers
