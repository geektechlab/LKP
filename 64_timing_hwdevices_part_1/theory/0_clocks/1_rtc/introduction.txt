RTC (Real Time Clock)
=======================

All PC's include a clock called Real Time Clock (RTC)

It is independent of CPU and all other chips.

It is backed by a small battery, which will allow it to tick even when the system is turned off.

In IBM compatible PCs, the RTC is mapped to the 0x70 and 0x71 I/O ports.

On boot, the kernel reads the RTC and uses it to initialize the wall time

The kernel does not typically read the value again.

Can be accessed using /dev/rtc* file

Reading and setting the RTC is then done via calls to ioctl.

Access RTC through command line
================================

To get what is stored in the RTC hardware clock execute as superuser:
$ hwclock

To set the hardware clock to some date and time you can use:

hwclock --set --date="10/08/89 13:19:00"

$hwclock --debug

dmesg | grep rtc

status information of rtc is exposed through /proc/driver/rtc
