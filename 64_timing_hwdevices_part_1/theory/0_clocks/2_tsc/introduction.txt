Time Stamp Counter (TSC)
---------------------------

The time stamp counter (TSC) is a hardware feature found on a number of contemporary processors. 

The TSC is a special register which is simply incremented every clock cycle. 

Eg. If clock is 2GHz, the counter will increment twice per nanosecond

Since the clock is the fundamental unit of time as seen by the processor, the TSC provides the highest-resolution timing information available for that processor.

It can thus be used for a number of applications, such as measuring the exact time cost of specific instructions or operations.

$ dmesg | grep tsc
