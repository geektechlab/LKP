Issues using TSC's with multi processor systems
------------------------------------------------

1. each core had its own TSC, in order to be sure that two measurements were accurate relative to each
other, it was neccessary to pin the measuring code to a single core.

2. the TSC would run at the frequency of the CPU itself: if that changed due to power management, the TSC ON that CPU would also slow down or stop.

Both of these problems are solved in more recent CPUs:

    • a constant TSC keeps all TSC’s synchronized across all cores in a system,
    • an invariant (or nonstop) TSC keeps the TSC running at a fixed rate regardless of changes in CPU frequency

How to check whether my CPU supports this
============================================

$ cat /proc/cpuinfo | grep -i tsc

        Flag            Meaning
        tsc             The system has a TSC clock.
        rdtscp          The RDTSCP instruction is available.
        constant_tsc    The TSC is synchronized across all sockets/cores.
        nonstop_tsc     The TSC is not affected by power management code.
