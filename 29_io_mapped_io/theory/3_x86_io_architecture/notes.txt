X86 I/O Architecture
====================
I/O Bus
===========

Data path connecting a CPU to an I/O device

I/O Ports
===========

Every device connected to the I/O bus has its own set of I/O addresses, also called as I/O Ports.

In the IBM PC architecture, I/O address space has up to 2^16 8-bit I/O ports (65536 8-bit I/O Ports)

	Two consecutive 8-bit ports may be regarded as a single 16-bit port, starting at an even address

	Two consecutive 16-bit ports may be regarded as a single 32-bit port, starting at an address divisible by 4
