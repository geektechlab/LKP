Where i can find the list of X86 I/O ports?
============================================

You can find them in the chipset documentation.

Port I/O access are handled by the Controller Hub (ICH/PCH) 

Example: IntelÂ® 7 Series Chipset Family PCH Datasheet (Section 9.3 I/O Map)

I/O Address space consists of two ranges or types of access

1. Fixed:

	Addresses/peripherals cannot be relocated

2. Variable:

	These addresses can be relocated (The BIOS (and/or other PCI devices or ACPI) can adjust these values)
