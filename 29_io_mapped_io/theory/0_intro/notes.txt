I/O
==========

Communication with peripherals is usually referred to as input and output, abbreviated I/O

I/O Memory and Ports
=====================

Memory Mapped IO and Port Mapped IO are the two methods of performing input/output (I/O) between the CPU and the peripheral devices.

Memory Mapped I/O
=================

	 Uses the same address bus to address both memory and I/O devices
	 When an address is accessed by the CPU, it may refer to 
		a portion of physical RAM, or
		to memory of the I/O device
	 CPU instructions used to access the memory can also be used for accessing devices.
	 Example : ARM Processors

Port Mapped I/O
==============

	Different address spaces for memory and I/O devices
	accomplished by an extra "I/O" pin on the CPU's physical interface, or an entire bus dedicated to I/O
	Uses a special class of CPU instructions to access I/O devices (IN and OUT)
	Example: Intel Processors
	X86 systems employ both-types of I/O
