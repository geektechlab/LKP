Causes of concurrency
=========================

1. Interrupts: An interrupt can occur asynchronously at almost any time; interrupting the currently executing code.

2. Softirqs and tasklets: Kernel can raise or schedule a softirq or tasklet at almost any time.

3. Kernel preemption: Because the kernel is preemptive, one task in the kernel can preempt another

4. Sleeping and synchronization with user space: Task in the kernel can sleep and thus invoke the scheduler, resulting in running of a new process.

5. Symmetrical multiprocessor: Two or more processors can execute kernel code at exactly the same time.
