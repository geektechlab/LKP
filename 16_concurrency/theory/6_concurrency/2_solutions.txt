Simple Solutions
==============

1. Kernel Preemption Disabling
----------------------------------

	disabling kernel preemption
	critical region start 
	......
	.....
	critical region end
	enable kernel preemption

Problem:
	On Multiprocessor, two kernel paths running on different CPUs can concurrently access the same global data

2. Disabling Hardware Interrupts
------------------------------------

	Disabling Hardware Interrupts
	critical region start
	......
	......
	critical region end
	enable hardware interrupts

Problem:
	If the critical region is large, interrupts can remain disabled for a relatively long time, potentially causing all hardware activities to freeze/ might get missed.

	On a multiprocessor system, disabling interrupts on the local CPU is not sufficient, and other synchronization techniques must be used.
