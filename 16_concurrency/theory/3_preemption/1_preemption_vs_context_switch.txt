What is preeemption?
====================

Preemption means forcefully taking away of the processor from one process and allocating it to another process. Switching 

Switching from one running task/process to another/process is known as context switch.

How it is implemented on Linux Kernel?
======================================

In the Linux kernel, the scheduler is called after each timer interrupt (that is, quite a few times per second). It determines what process to run next based on a variety of factors, including priority, time already run, etc.

Difference between preemption and context switch?
=================================================

Preemption: Firing of timer interrupt is preempting the current running process and running the interrupt service routine of timer interrupt

Context Switch: what happens when the kernel alters the state of the processor (the registers, mode, and stack) between one process or thread's context and another. 

context_switch() function is called in the kernel.
