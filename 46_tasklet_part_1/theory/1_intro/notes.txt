Tasklets
------------

Tasklets are bottom half mechanism built on top of softirqs.

Handlers of tasklets are executed by softirqs

Implementation
----------------

Tasklets are implemented on top of softirqs.

Tasklets are represented by two softirqs: HI_SOFTIRQ and TASKLET_SOFTIRQ.

The only difference in these types is that the HI_SOFTIRQ-based tasklets run prior to the TASKLET_SOFTIRQ based
tasklets.

Data Structure
----------------

tasklet_struct
Header File: <linux/interrupt.h>

struct tasklet_struct
{
        struct tasklet_struct *next; /* next tasklet in the list */
        unsigned long state;   /* state of the tasklet */
        atomic_t count;		/* reference counter */
        void (*func)(unsigned long); /* tasklet handler function */
        unsigned long data;  /* argument to the tasklet function */
};
