Adding Files to sysfs
======================

kobjects map to directories, what about files?

Attributes map kernel data to files in sysfs

Header File: <linux/sysfs.h>

struct attribute {
        const char              *name;
        umode_t                 mode;
};

name --> will be the file name of the resulting file in sysfs
mode --> permissions of the file in sysfs

A bare attribute contains no means to read or write the value of the attribute. 

struct kobj_attribute {
        struct attribute attr;
        ssize_t (*show)(struct kobject *kobj, struct kobj_attribute *attr,
                        char *buf);
        ssize_t (*store)(struct kobject *kobj, struct kobj_attribute *attr,
                         const char *buf, size_t count);
};

When an attribute is opened, a PAGE_SIZE buffer is allocated for transferring the data between the kernel and userspace

show(): Invoked when the sysfs entry is read from user space.
        It should copy the value of attribute given by attr into buffer(third argument)
        size of buffer is PAGE_SIZE
        Return Value:
                Success, Number of bytes written
                Negative error code on Failure

store(): Read the size bytes from the buffer into the variable represented by attribute attr.
        size of buffer is PAGE_SIZE or less
        Return Value:
                Success, Number of bytes read
                Negative error code on Failure
