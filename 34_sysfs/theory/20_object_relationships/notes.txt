Object Relationships
====================

Objects throughout the kernel are referenced by multiple subsystems.

When a block device is registered, a symbolic link is created to the device’s directory in the physical hierarchy

 A symbolic link is also created in the device’s directory that points to the corresponding directory under the block directory.

----
go in /sys/block and execute [ ls -la ] and check all are symbolic links.
----

int sysfs_create_link(struct kobject *kobj, struct kobject *target, char *name);

This function creates a link named name in the directory mapped from kobj to the directory mapped from target

Return Value:
        Success - 0
        Failure - Negative Error Code

void sysfs_remove_link(struct kobject *kobj, char *name);
