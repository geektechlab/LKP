Implemented in lib/kstrtox.c

int kstrtoint(const char *s, unsigned int base, int *res);

s: The start of the string. The string must be null-terminated, 
	The first character may also be a plus sign or a minus sign.

base:  The number base to use. The maximum supported base is 16.
	If base is given as 0, then the base of the string is automatically detected with the conventional semantics (eg. 0x)

res: Where to write the result of the conversion on success

Return: 0 on success
	-ERANGE on overflow
