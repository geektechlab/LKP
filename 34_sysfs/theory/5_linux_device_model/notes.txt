Linux Device Model
====================

Linux Device Model was introduced in 2.6

Purpose:
=========

To provide information like:

	1. what devices are in the system
	2. how they are in terms of power management
	3. what bus they are attached to
	4. what drivers they have

The device model provides a single mechanism for representing devices and describing their topology in the system.

Benefits:
============

--> The capability to enumerate all the devices in the system, view their status, and see to what bus they attach

--> The capability to generate a complete and valid tree of the entire device structure of the system, including all buses and interconnections

--> The capability to link devices to their drivers and vice versa

--> The capability to categorize devices by their class, such as input device, without the need to understand the physical device topology

--> The capability to walk the tree of devices from the leaves up to the root, powering down devices in the correct order
