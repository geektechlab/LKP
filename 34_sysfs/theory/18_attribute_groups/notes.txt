Attribute Groups
---------------------

The attribute group interface is a simplified interface for easily adding and removing a set of attributes with a single call.

struct attribute_group {
        const char              *name;
        umode_t                 (*is_visible)(struct kobject *,
                                              struct attribute *, int);
        umode_t                 (*is_bin_visible)(struct kobject *,
                                                  struct bin_attribute *, int);
        struct attribute        **attrs;
        struct bin_attribute    **bin_attrs;
};

An attribute group is simply an array of attributes to be added to an object, as represented by the attrs field

Why they were created?
---------------------

To make it easier to keep track of errors when registering multiple attributes at one time, and 
To make it more compelling to clean up all attributes that a piece of code may create for an object

static int sysfs_create_group(struct kobject *kobj, const struct attribute_group *grp)
