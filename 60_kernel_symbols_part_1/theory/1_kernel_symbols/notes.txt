Kernel Symbols
---------------

A symbol is either a variable or function.
It is name representing an space in memory which stores data (variable for reading/writing) or instructions(function for executing)

Kernel Symbols are visible at three different levels in the kernel source code.

1. static  : visible only within their own source file
2. extern  : visible to any other code built into the kernel
3. exported: visible and available to any loadable module
		Kernel code can make a symbol available to loadable modules with the EXPORT_SYMBOL() and EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL() macros

Kernel Symbol Table
----------------------

1. System.map	 : Contains symbols exported by code built into the kernel
2. /proc/kallsyms: Contains symbols exported by code built into the kernel + loadable kernel modules
