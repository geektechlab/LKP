The familiar system clock which tells the time of day is referred to as a real-time clock or a wall-clock.

To safely measure elapsed time in a program, you need a clock that ticks out time continuously, without any jumps when a user sets the system time. 

This kind of clock is called a monotonic clock.

int clock_gettime(clockid_t clk_id, struct timespec *tp);

The above function can be used to retrieve the time from various clocks, including the real-time clock.

clock_gettime vs gettimeofday
================================

1. Higher Precision

	struct timespec {
		time_t   tv_sec;        /* seconds */
		long     tv_nsec;       /* nanoseconds */
	};

2. Ability to request specific clocks.

	The clocks are identified by a clockid_t which is the first parameter of the function. 

For monotonic clock: clk_id = CLOCK_MONOTONIC
