What is cscope
==============

Cscope is a tool for efficient navigation of C sources.

Lot of time is saved with fast search rather than random grepping through the source files by hand.

Installation
===============

$ sudo apt install cscope

How to use it
==============

To use it, a cscope database must be generated from the existing sources.

In Linux Sources, 

$ make cscope

or

$ make ARCH=arm cscope

ARCH variable is optional but recommended, otherwise, some architecture dependent functions will appear multiple times in the database

In case of ARM, you can also use SUBARCH field

SUBARCH will be used to determine arch/arm/mach-* and arch/arm/plat-* directories, and these directories will be indexed

$ make ARCH=arm SUBARCH=omap2 cscope

Files Created:
=================

$ls cscope* -lh

1. cscope.files : this is the list of files that were indexed by cscope

2. cscope.out : cscope database

3. cscope.out.in, cscope.out.po : reverse index, to speed up lookups in the database.

The above make command is equivalent to:

cscope -bqkR

Where,

-b Build the cross-reference only
-q Enable fast symbol lookup via an inverted index
-k for kernel mode (avoids indexing /usr/include and other system directories)
-R Recursive for all directories
