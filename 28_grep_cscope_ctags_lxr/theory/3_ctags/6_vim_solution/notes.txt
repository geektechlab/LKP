Vim expects the tags file in the current directory.

$ cd kernel/locking
$ vi semaphore.c +182

If you do ctrl + ] it will throw an error: tag not found.

Solution: 
==========

Add 'set tags=tags;' to ~/.vimrc file

The last semicolon is the key here

When Vim tries to locate the 'tags' file, it first looks at the current directory, then the parent directory, then the parent of the parent, and so on
