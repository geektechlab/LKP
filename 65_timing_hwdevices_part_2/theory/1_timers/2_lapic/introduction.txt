Local APIC
==============

Problem with PIT is it is system wide resource, there is only one PIT even when there are multiple CPUs.

The Local APIC is a functional part of the APIC architecture, physically located in the CPU chip

Each Intel processor has Local APIC(Advance Programmable Interrupt Controller).

        ----------------
        |       CPU     |
        |  --------     |
        |  | Local|     |
        |  | APIC |     |
        |  -------      |
        ----------------

The local APIC includes a timer device with 32-bit counter

The timer can be configured by a special timer register.

Modes:
1. one-shot 
2. periodic
3. deadline

The local APIC timer sends an interrupt only to its processor, while the PIT raises a global interrupt, which may be handled by any CPU in the system.

The frequency of the LAPIC timer depends on the CPU bus clock and can  be configured within the range between the bus clock frequency and 1/128 of the bus clock frequency by setting a divider to any power of two between 1 and 128.
