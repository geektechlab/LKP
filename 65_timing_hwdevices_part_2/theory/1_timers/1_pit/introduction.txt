Programmable Interval Timer(PIT)
--------------------------------

In embedded systems, a programmable interval timer (PIT) is a counter that generates an output signal when it reaches a programmed count. The output signal may trigger an interrupt.

PIT's may be
    One-Shot: Signal only once and stop counting
    Periodic: Signal every time they reach a specific value and restart

X86 machine has one PIT, implemented by an 8254 chip

PIT is accessed on ports 0x40-0x43

The chip itself has 3 channels: 

Channel 0 is tied to is tied to IRQ0, to interrupt the CPU at predictable and regular times, 
Channel 1 is system specific, and 
Channel 2 is connected to the system speaker.

I/O port     Usage
0x40         Channel 0 data port (read/write)
0x41         Channel 1 data port (read/write)
0x42         Channel 2 data port (read/write)
0x43         Mode/Command register (write only, a read is ignored)

Frequency: 1.193182 MHZ

Initial version of Linux before 2.6 PIT was used as system timer.
