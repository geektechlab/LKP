What will happen if a wake_up comes just before prepare_to_wait() and after the while condition? 

The wakeup will be lost.

prepare_to_wait() must be called before the condition is checked.

----
DEFINE_WAIT(wait); // defining wait queue entry
add_wait_queue(queue, &wait); // adding wait queue entry
while (!condition) { // checking condition if list is empty or not, if list is not empty, come inside
    prepare_to_wait(&queue, &wait, TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE); // set state to interruptible
    if (signal_pending(current)) //
        /* handle signal */
    schedule();
}
finish_wait(&queue, &wait);

at line no.11 signal may get lost if process is preempted
