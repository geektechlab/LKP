Adding an element into wait queue
==================================

Once an element is defined, it must be inserted into a wait queue.

Two different functions are used to add sleeping processes into a wait queue.

	add_wait_queue()

	add_wait_queue_exclusive()

add_wait_queue() function inserts a nonexclusive process in the first position of a wait queue list.

void add_wait_queue(struct wait_queue_head *wq_head, struct wait_queue_entry *wq_entry);

add_wait_queue_exclusive() function inserts an exclusive process in the last position of a wait queue list.

void add_wait_queue_exclusive(struct wait_queue_head *wq_head, struct wait_queue_entry *wq_entry);

The remove_wait_queue( ) function removes a process from a wait queue list.

void remove_wait_queue(struct wait_queue_head *wq_head, struct wait_queue_entry *wq_entry);

Implementation: kernel/sched/wait.c
