Thundering Herd Problem
==============================

	When a process calls wake_up on a wait queue, all processes waiting on the wait queue are made runnable.

	Consider a scenario in which a set of processes are sleeping on wait queue, wanting to acquire lock.

	--->	The process that has acquired the lock is done with it, releases the lock

	--->	All the processes that are sleeping for it will wake up

	--->	All processes try to grab lock

	--->	Only one of these acquires the lock and the rest goes back to sleep

	If the number of procesess in the wait queue is large, it seriously degrades the performance of system.

	As, it consumes valuable CPU cycles and incur context-switching overheads.
