Why is coarse variants faster than non-coarse variants
--------------------------------------------------------

ktime_get() (unlike the ktime_get_coarse()) eventually invokes timekeeping_get_delta() which reads clocksource with tk_clock_read()

They doesn't read the hardware instead they read from a global timekeeping structure, which gets updated every timer tick. This can be 10ms in the past

Skipping the hardware clock access saves around 100 CPU cycles on most modern machines with a reliable cycle counter, but up to several microseconds on older hardware with an external clocksource
