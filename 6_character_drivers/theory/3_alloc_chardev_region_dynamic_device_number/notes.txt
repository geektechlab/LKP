Dynamic Allocation
===================

If we dont want fixed major and minor number please use this method.

This method will allocate the major number dynamically to your driver which is available.

it is advantageous over static method because conflict will not happen and kernel will allocate available number automatically.

int alloc_chrdev_region (dev_t *  dev,
		 	unsigned  	baseminor,
 			unsigned  	count,
		 	const char *  	name);

Description
=================

Allocates a range of char device numbers.
The major number will be chosen dynamically, and returned (along with the first minor number) in dev

Arguments
===============

dev 		-->	output parameter for first assigned number
baseminor 	--> 	first of the requested range of minor numbers
count		-->	the number of minor numbers required
name		-->	the name of the associated device or driver


Return Value
=============
Returns zero or a negative error code.

-------------
suppose if we create duplicate copy of .ko then even we will not be able to load same module again because, name of module will remain same. check it by [ modinfo <name>.ko ]
