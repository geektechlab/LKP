Creating Device File
=======================

Device file can be created in two ways
	1. Manual
	2. Automatic

Manual
===========

We can create the device file manually by using mknod.

$ mknod -m <permissions> <name> <device type> <major> <minor>

-m <permissions> – optional argument that sets the permission bits of the new device file to permissions

<name> – your device file name that should have full path (/dev/name)

<device type> – Put c or b
	c – Character Device

	b – Block Device

<major> – major number of your device

<minor> – minor number of your driver

Eg. 

$sudo mknod -m 0644 /dev/mydevice c 244 10

-----
device file is independent of device driver. We can create device file before creating device driver also.
