Clobbering
----------

Besides general purpose registers, we can pass two special specifiers

	cc
	memory

cc
--------

cc indicates that an assembler code modifies flag register.
This is typically used if the assembly statements contains arithmetic and logic instructions.

Example: asm volatile("incq %0" ::""(variable): "cc");

memory
-----------

informs compiler that the given inline assembly statement executes read/write operations on memory not specified by operands in the output list.

This prevents the compiler from keeping memory values loaded and cached in registers
