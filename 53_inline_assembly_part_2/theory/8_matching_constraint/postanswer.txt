why do matching constraints exist when you can just use "+r"(var) for a read/write operand, instead of the more complicated matching-constraint syntax?"
=================================================================================================================

They're rarely useful.

If you don't want to use the same C var for input and output, but still need them to pick the same register or memory, then you want a matching constraint
