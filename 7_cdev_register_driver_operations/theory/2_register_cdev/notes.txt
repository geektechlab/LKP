struct cdev
==================================

In kernel, each character device is represented using this structure.

Header File: linux/cdev.h

struct cdev
{
		/* module */
        struct kobject kobj;
        struct module *owner;
        const struct file_operations *ops;
        struct list_head list;
        dev_t dev;
        unsigned int count;
} __randomize_layout;


Functions:
=============

void cdev_init(struct cdev *, const struct file_operations *); --> initialize a cdev structure

struct cdev *cdev_alloc(void); --> Allocates and returns a cdev structure

int cdev_add(struct cdev *, dev_t, unsigned int minor_count); --> add a char device to the system

void cdev_del(struct cdev *dev); --> remove a cdev from the system
