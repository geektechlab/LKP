Does executing CLI instruction disable interrupts on other processors
------------------------------------------------------------------------

In multiprocessor systems, executing a CLI instruction does not disable interrupts on other processors

Thus, a driver/interrupt handler race condition can still occur because other processors may service interrupts and execute the offending interrupt handler.

Other synchronization mechanisms such as locks must be used in addition to CLI/STI to prevent all race conditions.
