A page fault is generated when the kernel traps an access to a page that has not been mapped.

In fact, there are two kinds of page fault: minor and major. 

With a minor fault, the kernel just has to find a page of physical memory and map it into the process address space

A major page fault occurs when the virtual memory is mapped to a file, for example using mmap(2)

major faults are much more expensive in time and system resources
