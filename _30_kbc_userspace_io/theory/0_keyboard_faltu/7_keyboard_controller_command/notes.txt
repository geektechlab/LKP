Keyboard Controller Commands:
=============================

Keyboard controller accepts commands and process them.

To send a command to the controller, write the command byte to IO port 0x64

	Arguments, if any, must be passed using address 0x60
	Results are returned on port 0x60.
	
Always test the OBF ("Output Buffer Full") flag before writing commands or parameters to the 8042.

0x20 (Read Command Byte) - Returns command byte
0x60 (Write Command Byte) - Stores parameter as command byte

INT (Input Buffer Full Interrupt) - When set, IRQ 1 is generated when data is available in
the input buffer.
	0: IBF Interrupt Disabled - You must poll STATUS<IBF> to read input.
	1: IBF Interrupt Enabled - Keyboard driver at software int 0x09 handles input.

SYS (System Flag) - Used to manually set/clear SYS flag in Status register.
	0: Power-on value - Tells POST to perform power-on tests/initialization.
	1: BAT code received - Tells POST to perform "warm boot" tests/initiailization.

OVR (Inhibit Override) - Overrides keyboard's "inhibit" switch on older motherboards.
	0:Inhibit switch enabled - Keyboard inhibited if pin P17 is high.
	1: Inhibit switch disabled - Keyboard not inhibited even if P17 = high.

_EN (Disable keyboard) - Disables/enables keyboard interface.
	0: Enable - Keyboard interface enabled.
	1: Disable - All keyboard communication is disabled.

PC ("PC Mode") - ???Enables keyboard interface somehow???
	0: Disable - ???
	1: Enable - ???

XLAT (Translate Scan Codes) - Enables/disables translation to set 1 scan codes.
	0: Translation disabled - Data appears at input buffer exactly as read from keyboard
	1: Translation enabled - Scan codes translated to set 1 before put in input buffer

INT2 (Mouse Input Buffer Full Interrupt) - When set, IRQ 12 is generated when mouse
data is available.
	0: Auxillary IBF Interrupt Disabled -
	1: Auxillary IBF Interrupt Enabled -

_EN2 (Disable Mouse) - Disables/enables mouse interface.
	0: Enable - Auxillary PS/2 device interface enabled
	1: Disable - Auxillary PS/2 device interface disabled
