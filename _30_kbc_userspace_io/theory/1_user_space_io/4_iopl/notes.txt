Accessing I/O Ports
====================

To input a byte (8 bits) from a port, call inb(port), it returns the byte it got

unsigned char inb(unsigned short int port);

To output a byte, call outb(value, port)

void outb(unsigned char value, unsigned short int port);

Header File : <sys/io.h>

 To input a word (16 bits) from ports x and x+1, call inw(x)

unsigned short int inw(unsigned short int port);

To output a word to the two ports, use outw(value, x).

void outw(unsigned short int value, unsigned short int port);

The inb_p(), outb_p(), inw_p(), and outw_p() macros work otherwise identically to the ones above, but they do an additional short (about one microsecond) delay after the port access;
