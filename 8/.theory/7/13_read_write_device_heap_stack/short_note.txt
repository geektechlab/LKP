same as previous but with use of stack section variable in kernel module in stack which gets user space pointer to memory. 

here it may not work becuase stack content gets copied from user space but it points to user space pointer but directly accessing will violate security policy. ( indiactions: dmesg may get freezed )

To make it work, TBD

check what type of device it is ? charactor or block ?
