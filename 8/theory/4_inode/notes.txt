struct inode
==============

we can verify inode related information using stat command. [ stat hello.c ]

The inode structure is used by the kernel internally to represent files. 

An inode uniquely identifies a file in a file system. It represents a file on disk. struct inode is different from struct file. Whenever we open a file, struct file gets created. But when file gets created, struct inode gets created.

struct inode {
	//mode
	umode_t                 i_mode;

	kuid_t                  i_uid;
    kgid_t                  i_gid;

	//inode number
	unsigned long           i_ino;

	//Contains the actual device number
	dev_t                   i_rdev;

	// Kernel representation of char device
	struct cdev *i_cdev
};

Kernel developers have added two macros that can be used to obtain the major and minor numbers from an inode.
( MAJOR(inode->i_rdev), MINOR(inode->i_rdev) )

unsigned int iminor(struct inode *inode);
unsigned int imajor(struct inode *inode);
