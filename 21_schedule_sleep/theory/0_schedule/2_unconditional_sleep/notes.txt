When the schedule() function is called with the state as TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE or TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE, an additional step is performed

	the currently executing process is moved off the run queue before another process is scheduled. 
	The effect of this is the executing process goes to sleep, as it no longer is on the run queue.
	Hence, it never is scheduled by the scheduler. And, that is how a process can sleep.
