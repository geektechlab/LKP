The following is a snippet from kernel/kthread.c

set_current_state(TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE);
if (list_empty(&kthread_create_list))
	schedule();
__set_current_state(TASK_RUNNING);

Here in this code, it is checking the condition only after setting the state to TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE

Why do you think last line is needed?
=================================================

It is setting the task state to RUNNING, as there are chances that the list_empty condition may fail() and schedule() will never be called.
