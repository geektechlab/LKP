How to find out what wait channels processes are waiting on?
============================================================

$ ps -l (to see processes associated with the current shell)

$ ps -el (to see all processes on the system)

 If a process is in Sleep state, the WCHAN field shows the system call that the process is waiting on

WCHAN(Wait Channel) - name of the kernel function in which the process is sleeping

State:
======
 D    uninterruptible sleep (usually IO)

 S    interruptible sleep (waiting for an event to complete)
