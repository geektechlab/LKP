Waking up
===============

	Given a reference to a task structure, the process could be woken up by calling:

	wake_up_process(sleeping_task);

	Implementation: kernel/sched/core.c

	-->	this sets the task state to TASK_RUNNING

	-->	puts the task back on the run queue.

	Note:	the process runs only when the scheduler looks at it the next time around.

	Return: 
		1 if the process was woken up, 
		0 if it was already running.

example is a device driver showing skeep and wake of process.
