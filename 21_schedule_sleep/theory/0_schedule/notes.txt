Scheduler
================

Schedule() implements the scheduler.

Implementation: kernel/sched.c

The most important data structure used by scheduler is run queue.

Run Queue: Contains the list of all processes which are in TASK_RUNNING state.

Each CPU has its own run queue and each active process will be present on just one run queue.


How it is invoked?
=====================

1. Direct Way: When the current process do not have the resource it needs, and want to block itself until it acquires the resource, it calls schedule

2. Lazy Way: When the time quantum/time slice of the current process is completed.
