Theory0:

Sometimes processes may need to go to Sleep state for a particular amount of time

void msleep(unsigned int msecs);
Header File : <linux/delay.h>

msleep will put the processor into uninterruptible sleep.
[ ps ] will show you 'D' as the state

Theory1:
unsigned long msleep_interruptible(unsigned int msecs);
	will put the process into interruptible sleep

Return value : 
	Normally 0

	If the process is awakened early, then the return value is number of milliseconds remaining in the
	original requested sleep period

Theory2:
void ssleep(unsigned int seconds);
Header File: <linux/delay.h>

it is uninterruptible sleep.
