Create a device and register it with sysfs ( creates devnode )

struct device * device_create(struct class *class,
 			      struct device *parent,
			      dev_t  devt,
			      void *drv_data,
 			      const char *fmt,
		 	      ...);

This function can be used by char device classes. 

A struct device will be created in sysfs, registered to the specified class.

class 	-->	pointer to the struct class that this device should be registered to (it returns a pointer )

parent  -->	pointer to the parent struct device of this new device, if any

devt    --> 	the dev_t for the char device to be added

fmt	-->     string for the device's name

...	-->	variable arguments

If a pointer to a parent struct device is passed in, the newly created struct device will be a child of that device in sysfs. 

device_destroy â€” removes a device that was created with device_create

void device_destroy (struct class *class, dev_t devt);
