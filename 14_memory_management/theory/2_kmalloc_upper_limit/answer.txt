The upper limit (number of bytes that can be allocated in a single kmalloc request), is a function of:
	the processor – really, the page size – and the number of buddy system freelists (MAX_ORDER).

( check in include/linux/slab.h [ IMP: video 24:00 - 29:00 ] )

On both x86 and ARM, with a standard page size of 4 Kb and MAX_ORDER of 11

#define KMALLOC_SHIFT_MAX       (MAX_ORDER + PAGE_SHIFT - 1)

MAX_ORDER = 11 , PAGE_SHIFT = 12 = 11 + 12 -1 = 22

/* Maximum allocatable size */
#define KMALLOC_MAX_SIZE        (1UL << KMALLOC_SHIFT_MAX) = 2^22 = 4*1024*1024 = 4MB
